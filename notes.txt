Meeting with Ammon about mcmc issues 11 Oct. 2022

mixture model is non-identifiable 
two alternative ways to fit components to data:
	high variance & low variance (this is finding that the lowest-count genes are more likely to be expressed than not-expressed)
	high mean & low mean 

solution: 
	for both tissues: 
	Change variance prior (uniform between upper and lower)
	Also change threshold_a = "" to a vector of values for the minimum limits
	active_variance_prior_max = 3.5
	threshold_a = c(0,3.5)
	

Isoform-specific expression patterns? 
Try both isoform-level and gene-level

below 50% chance of being expressed = throw out 

Old runs moved into "original_runs." These use default settings for the prior variance
